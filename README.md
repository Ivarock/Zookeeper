Zookeeper is an application where you can manage the happiness and food reserves of various animals, by petting them, working or playing with them and feeding them.
Each animal has its happiness value as well as type of food he likes.
When animals play their happiness increases but food reserves gets lower.
When animals need to work, their happiness value drops as well as their food reserves.
The food that you give animal must be validated and if the wrong food is given the animals happiness drops and food reserves drops twice instead of increasing.
